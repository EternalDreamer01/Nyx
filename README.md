## FAQ

### Is the user notified about this ?
No

### Is it possible to login as another phone number but personal ?
Yes - it'd be advised to prevent ban - it's a common thing to buy a prepaid SIM card from tobacconists or local stores.

### Can a user actually have WhatsApp or Telegram but doesn't appear ?
Yes, users can always change their profile visibility. To view or edit these settings :
* WhatsApp : Settings > Privacy
* Telegram : Settings > Privacy and Security

### Are there any risk ?
Your phone can be banned by WhatsApp and/or Telegram, make sure to not overuse this application.
A reasonable reverse lookup frequency would be 40/day (each one different), waiting at least a few seconds seconds between each call, at an irregular frequency.
Use a prepaid SIM card to prevent such situations.

### Is it legal ?
It's legal to view publicly available information. However, scraping would violate Terms of Use of WhatsApp and Telegram and would result in a permanent suspension.

### What's the difference between "name", "pushname" and "shortname" ?
|||
|-|-|
| `name` | The name registered for this phone number on your personal WhatsApp account |
| `shortname` | Your prefered shortname configured on your device (first name or last name), when this phone number is registered on your WhatsApp account |
| `pushname` | The name configured on their WhatsApp |

## Frequent Issues

### Cache
If you were getting this error:
```
Error: Evaluation failed: Error: wid error: invalid wid
```
Try cleaning up cache using `nyx-lookup --clean` or `rm -rf ~/.cache/nyx-lookup/`

### Outdated Version
If you were getting this error:
```
Error: Evaluation failed: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'default')
```
Make sure you have the latest version of Nyx, or try reinstalling. If you installed it globally using npm:
```sh
npm uninstall -g nyx-lookup
npm install -g nyx-lookup
```

## Known issues
At the moment, `whatsapp-web.js` depends on a vulnerable version of `puppeteer`, see `npm audit` for more information.
